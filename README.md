Jido is a conversational tactile map and a mobile application prototype to improve the orientation and mobility of visually impaired people. The tactile map can identify the user's touch gestures and their locations during tactile exploration to provide feedback. Users can verbally interact with a conversational agent through their mobile device to receive confirmation, request information of points of interest, and receive step-by-step instructions that can be later reviewed during navigation.
